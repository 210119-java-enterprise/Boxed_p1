# Boxed_p1
A ORM that allows for a simplified and SQL-free interaction with the relational database

# Install:
Currently the project is not in the maven repository. To include in your own project it must be downloaded and installed to your local .m2 file where it can then be inlcuded as a dependency to future projects using :
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.revature</groupId>
            <artifactId>Boxed</artifactId>
            <version>1.0</version>
        </dependency>
        
Included in your project should be a .properties file that resembles the following:

url=jdbc:postgresql://\<HOST\>:\<PORT\>/\<DATABASE_NAME\> <br/>
admin-usr= \<USERNAME\> <br/>
admin-pw=\<PASSWORD\> <br/>
current-schema=\<SCHEMA\> <br/>
entity-location= \<ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_DESIRED_CLASS\>,\<ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_DESIRED_CLASS\>, ...
  
 The classes that get included in your .properties file as entity containers should be annotated using the following annotations:
<ul> 
  <li> @Entity : at the top of any class that represents a table in your database</li>
  <li> @Column : at the top of any filed that represents a column in your database</li>
  <li> @CredentialsClass : at the top of the class that holds login information </li>
  <li> @Credential : at the top of the fields used as username and password </li>
  <li> @Generated : at the top of any field that is generated by the database and should be skipped durring inserts</li>
</ul>

# Use:
There is one client facing class:

BlackBox: 
  - Allows you to get a new connection and set currentConnection
  - Allows you to execute a transaction stored in a string
  - Allows you to get a ResultSet 'Summary' that shows what the raw result set holds
  - Allows you to retrieve or insert entire objects to avoid creating custom transactions. 
  
Some classes that might come in handy to explore include the TransactionBuilder classes:
  - Delete Builder
  - Insert Builder
  - QueryBuilder
  - UpdateBuilder
  - WhereBuilder
